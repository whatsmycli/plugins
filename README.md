## üì¶ How this repository works

- Each plugin should be added under its own folder:
plugins/
weather/
linux.so
windows.dll
mac.dylib

- Only **compiled binaries** are required.  
- The PR **must include a link** to the plugin's **original source repository**.  
- You are **not required to submit source code** here ‚Äî only verified, open-source binaries.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All submissions must be open-source. Proprietary or closed-source binaries will **not** be accepted.

## ‚ö° Using Plugins

Once a plugin is merged into this repository, it can be invoked from **whatsmycli** using the **plugin folder name** as the command.  

For example, if a plugin is added under:
plugins/weather/
linux.so
windows.dll
mac.dylib


You can call it with:

```bash
whatsmy weather
```

The folder name becomes the plugin command.

Ensure the plugin binaries are correctly placed for your operating system.
